                Hi!
                <br>
                It‚Äôs been a really long while since I‚Äôve blogged. We‚Äôre talking Xanga days, folks. But here we go.
                <br>
                (and no, this isn‚Äôt the launch of another web3 project).
            </p>

            <p>
                Late last year, I took a genetic screening test on a lark. Mostly to quell my curiosity, to understand my body predictively. Gave a vial of blood and very little thought to it.
            </p>
<p>
    Unexpectedly, my test results revealed I have the BRCA2 gene mutation.
</p>

<p>
    Fast forward to this summer, my MRI scan came back abnormal in my left breast. Got a core needle biopsy done. Waited. In July 2022, results confirmed I have invasive breast cancer. 
</p>
<p>
    My instinct: cancel everything and retreat into the woods. Overwhelm and anxiety pooled around me, drowning any sense of focus or clarity on where to begin, how to begin.
</p>
<p>
    A wise friend messaged me this: <br>
    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to switch into execution mode rather than despair, anxiety or the like. Treat it like a project.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
    Since then, I took a deep dive into my prognosis.  I went on a nationwide tour of multiple hospitals. Spoke with dozens of doctors, scientists, practitioners, professors. My phone now has eight different patient portal apps. Hours worth of recorded consultations with specialists. Several gigs worth of digital articles and research papers. There‚Äôs a mounting stack of books, binders, and pamphlets. Oh, and I have coupons for brassieres with prosthesis pockets (lmk if anyone needs). 
</p>

<p>
    My surgery is on Monday, October 24th at Stanford Cancer Center. <br>
    The surgery will be a double mastectomy. 
</p>

<p>
    Optimism and humor became strategic and necessary tools for this project. But I‚Äôd be remiss if I didn‚Äôt admit that feelings of dread or anxiety creep in unannounced but I have learned the value in welcoming them, too. 

</p>
<p>
    There‚Äôs a poem by Persian poet Rumi that was recited to me recently. <br>
    It resonates beautifully and I‚Äôd love to share with you.
</p>

        The Guest House
    </p>
    <p id="poem">
        This being human is a guest house. <br>
        Every morning a new arrival.
        <br> <br>
        A joy, a depression, a meanness, <br>
        some momentary awareness comes <br>
        as an unexpected visitor.
        <br> <br>
        Welcome and entertain them all! <br>
        Even if they are a crowd of sorrows, <br>
        who violently sweep your house <br>
        empty of its furniture, <br>
        still, treat each guest honorably. <br>
        He may be clearing you out <br>
        for some new delight.
        <br> <br>
        The dark thought, the shame, the malice, <br>
        meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.
        <br> <br>
        Be grateful for whatever comes. <br>
        because each has been sent <br>
        as a guide from beyond.
    </p>
</div>

<br>
<p>
    So, I am welcoming every feeling, thought, scream, laughter, and sob that sweeps through my soul. And trying to treat each one of them honorably.
</p>
<p>
    So thank you for lifting me and my two ladies up.  <br>
    Infinitely better than any push-up bra a girl could hope for.
</p>
<p>
    To many new delights ahead.
</p>

<p>
    With so much love,<br>
    Esther
